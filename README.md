# ProgrammableTrains

You are a train engineer. You have been charged of building a railway to bring 100 units of coals to the factory. Watch out your trains don't run out of coal!

Fun fact: trains are programmable javascript snippets

To run the game: clone repo, python3 -m http.server, open index.html

BUGS:
- mines work only if approached from left and bottom
- if coal goes down from one mine goes down also from other mines?
