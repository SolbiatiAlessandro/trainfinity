You are a train engineer. You have been charged of building a railway to bring 100 units of coals to the factory. Watch out your trains don't run out of coal!

Fun fact: trains are programmable javascript snippets

To run the game: clone repo, python3 -m http.server, open index.html

GAME STORY:
- given 999$, train and 100 free coal to bring to factory, rail costs 5, vagon costs 1000, train costs 3000
- factory gives you 10.000$ for those 100 coal, start to produce alluminium, buys steel for more

FEATURES:
- PROGRAMMABLE (write access to player) TRAINS
- PROGRAMMABLE (read access to player) mines and factories
- introduce money
- paid money to sell coal to factories
- factories produce steel with 100 coal
- factorioes buy steel for more money
- use money to buy vagons so that train last longer
- mines get upgraded as game progresses

BUGS:
- [half fixed] mines work only if approached from left and bottom
- if coal goes down from one mine goes down also from other mines?
